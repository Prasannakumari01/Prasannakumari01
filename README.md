# Hi, I'm Prasanna Kumari Guntoju 👋

I’m a B.Tech Computer Science (Data Science) student who believes that strong fundamentals and disciplined practice matter more than shortcuts.  
I approach technology with curiosity, patience, and a focus on understanding *why things work*, not just *how to use them*.

---

## 🧠 How I Approach Technology
- I focus on **core computer science concepts** and gradually layer applied skills on top
- I prefer understanding systems end-to-end rather than isolated tools
- I value clarity, correctness, and maintainability in code
- I treat projects as a way to test understanding, not as an end goal

---

## 🔭 What I’m Currently Working On
- Improving analytical and logical thinking through **Data Structures & Algorithms**
- Deepening my understanding of **machine learning workflows**, from data preparation to evaluation
- Strengthening intuition around **data, features, and performance trade-offs**
- Writing cleaner code and maintaining well-structured GitHub repositories

## 🌱 How I Learn
I learn best by breaking complex topics into smaller, understandable parts and validating my understanding through practice.  
I actively seek feedback, revisit fundamentals when needed, and focus on consistency over speed.

---

## 🎯 What I’m Aiming For
- Build technically sound and meaningful software
- Strengthen my foundation as a computer science engineer
- Contribute to projects where learning and correctness matter
- Grow into roles that value problem-solving and long-term thinking
